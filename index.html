            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The 2022 Wisconsin fall general election presents a challenge to anyone trying to understand how to build multiracial
                governing coalitions in the state
                or the Midwest. Democrat Tony Evers won re-election, becoming the first Democratic 
                gubernatorial candidate in Wisconsin since 1962 to win a midterm election while a Democrat occupied the White House. 
                But Democrat Mandela Barnes lost, though narrowly, to an opponent who was seen as the most vulnerable Republican 
                in the Senate.  Barnes, of course, is Black: did that fact make him even more vulnerable than his opponent, Ron Johnson?
                Are statewide elections out of reach for candidates of color, in Wisconsin specifically or the midwest generally?

            <p>
                Barnes only lost by 26,718 votes, which is about 1% of the total votes cast.  That's not unusual for a statewide race in Wisconsin, where the margin of victory or defeat
                is often on the scale of a rounding error in the total vote.  Johnson won by 99,000 votes in 2016 and 105,000 votes in 2010, so Barnes came much
                closer to beating him than anyone else has to date.  On the other hand, in 2010 and 2016 as in 2022, Johnson was polling far behind his opponent through the summer before the 
                election. That the people running Barnes' campaign were unable to see this coming is disappointing.

                The argument has been made</a> that something inherent in the electorate, or inherent in Barnes, doomed his effort from the start.
              
                    <blockquote>Yet other Democrats believe [Barnes'] positions on crime and policing — favoring reducing the prison population, supporting ending 
                        cash bail and displaying an “Abolish ICE T-shirt — hurt him in a state like Wisconsin.
                        “Mandela’s problems on crime did him in,” said one Democratic strategist familiar with the race. “It was always his biggest vulnerability.”
                        Added another Democratic strategist: “Mandela’s team was fully aware there would be issues, particularly relating to crime, 
                        that the campaign would need to address.” 
                    </blockquote>    
            </p>
            <p>Explanations such as this one (usually offered anonymously) deny all agency to Johnson, and importantly also to "yet other Democrats," while making Barnes' positions on crime and policing "in a state like Wisconsin" out to be fundamental defects.</p>
            <p>We disagree. <b>We believe that Barnes' campaign,<sup>1</sup> specifically the people driving its strategy, made poor decisions that sealed his fate.</b> These decisions were not inevitable, others could have been made. Below we 
                review 3 areas where the campaign could have chosen differently:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The campaign's messaging to voters, especially suburban voters, was poor across the state.</li><br>
                    <li>Insufficient effort was made to mobilize Barnes' base, especially in the Democratic strongholds of Milwaukee and Dane Counties.</li><br>
                    <li>Too much of the campaign budget went to out-of-state canvass vendors, and to media buys rather than voter mobilization.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <!-- <h3>Suburban Voters Bailed on Barnes</h3> -->

        <h4>A Brief Review of Recent Wisconsin Election History:</h4>
        <p> First, Obama carried Wisconsin in both 2008 and 2012, so to claim that it's impossible for a Black candidate to win here flies in the face of facts.  </p>
        <p>
            It's more reasonable to ask whether an anti-right-wing electorate exists in Wisconsin.  Hillary Clinton just assumed there was one in 2016; she famously did not even bother to visit the state
            during her run for the Presidency, but found out to her dismay that it's not to be taken for granted.  In the wake of that exercise, conventional wisdom was willing to write the state off,
            seeing that the effort to recall Scott Walker in 2012 failed decisively, Walker was re-elected in 2014, and Trump was elected in 2016. </p>
        <p>
            However, more recent evidence shows that white liberal centrists (other than Clinton) have been able to do well in statewide elections here.  Since 2018, they have won all of the statewide constitutional offices, and one Senate seat. 
            Their results in state Supreme Court races have been more mixed, but overall the record would indicate that the 2022 Senate race was one that should not have gotten away.  That said, evidence also shows
            that the wins when they come are extremely close -- the Republicans have a formidable machine. </p> 
        <p>  
            To understand how they used it to beat Barnes, we begin by looking at the "Evers-Johnson Voters"
        </p>
            


            <fn id=fn1><sup>1</sup>Here and below, we ascribe agency to "Barnes' campaign" rather than to Barnes himself, because it's impossible to know from the outside where the agency lies.  
                It's common practice for big-money campaigns such as this one to be run
                by a group of consultants and operatives retained by campaign funders to manage the campaign on the candidate's behalf.  Rather than being in charge of campaign decisions, the candidate's role is an
                advisory one at best.  By accepting the funds the candidate sacrifices control.
