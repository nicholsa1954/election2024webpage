            <h2>The "Effort Remaining" Metric</h2>
            <p> I'm trying to develop an "Effort Remaining" concept to measure our progress in a ward, city, or county. </p> 
            <p> I begin with a concept of a "win number" defined as 53% of a weighted average of 3x the total votes in the 2012, 2016, and 2020 Presidential elections, and the 2028 and 2022 Governor's elections. </p>
            <p> That win number will be harder to attain in some places and easier in others, so we need a concempt of a "lift".  The "lift" is 1 / the probability of a Democrat being elected in that ward, averaged over the elections
                of 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020. "Lift" should always be equal to or greater than 1.0.  It acts as a coefficient when, applied to the "win number", creates a measure of the effort necessary
                (as a count of voter commitments) to achieve the win number.  The "effort remaining" is that measure minus Biden's vote count in 2020.
            </p>
