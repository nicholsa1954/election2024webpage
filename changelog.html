            <h4>Version of 9/26/24</h4>
            <p><ul>
                <li>The algorithm for computing the support goal, supporter ID goal, voter gap, and projected values is unchanged from the previous version.</li>
                <li>The billboard is edited, see the image below.</li>      
                <!-- <li>The two turfs for the Fox River Valley (Outagamie County and Winnebago County) are combined.</li> -->
                <li>The color bar is changed to map the Supporter ID Goal using the turf rather than the whole state as a basis. The range of the color bar is [0... max of Supporter ID Goal
                     in the turf]. For each map there should be at least one ward colored nearly opaque black and at least one ward colored nearly transparent white, with the meaning 
                    of the colors expressed in the range of values shown on the color bar to the right of the image.</li>

            <h4>Version of 9/19/24</h4>
            <p><ul>
                <li>The "offyear growth factor" ((Evers22 - Evers18)/(2*Evers18)) is always less than or equal to zero</li>
                <li>"Projected growth" is Biden20 * (1.0 + growth factor). It is at the most Biden20, or more if growth factor is negative</li>
                <li>The "Voter Gap" is 110% of Biden's 2020 vote minus the sum of "Projected growth" and "New IDs"</li>
                <li>The "Supporter ID Goal" is 2 times the "Voter Gap"</li>
                <li>The color bar on the images now maps this new "Supporter Goal" metric.</li>
                <li>The range of the color bar is capped at the maximum of the "Suporter Goal" metric across all turfs.</li>

            <p><ul>
                <li>"Supporter Goal" is 110% of Biden's 2020 vote plus half the loss, if any, from (Evers22 - Evers18)/Evers18. </li>
                <li>"Effort Remaining" is "SupporterGoal" minus the sum of "ModeledIDs" and "NewIDs".</li>
                <li>"Effort Remaining" is renamed to "Voter Gap".</li>
                <li>Color bars on the map show the voter gap, clamped in the range [0.0, 900].</li>
